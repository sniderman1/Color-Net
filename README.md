# Color-Net
Using Brain.js, Color Net is a neural net that can perceive colors like you do.   

This project uses the MIT's neural net Brain.js.

1. Open the HTML file in your browser
2. Click the start button
3. Choose a color in your head. For example, say you chose red. There will 15 plus random colors that will be shown to you. You choose how close the color is to red between 0% and 100%.
4. Decide how close the random colors are to your chosen color
5. After you have reached 15 color a button "Train net" will appear. You may click the button or continue to input more data. The more data you input the more accurate the neural net will be. 
6. Once you have click the "Train net" button the program will begin to train the neural net with your data. 
7. Once the net is done training it will output 60 squares that will be close to the color you picked in your head. There will be percentages on each square on how close that color is. The accuracy is dependent on how much data you inputted and if you had any random colors that were close to your chosen color.

This was a fun little project to see what I could do with Brain.js. I hope to produce more projects in the future utilizing this program. 

Special thanks to MIT for making Brain.js an open source JavaScript neural net.
